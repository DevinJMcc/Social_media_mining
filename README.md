# Classification of Covid-19 Vaccination Side Effects

This reposityor is designed to accompany the work presented in the paper Classification of Covid-19 Vaccination Side Effects.<br>

The structure of this directory is seperated into three main directories, Model Scripts, Research Paper, and training_models.
Inside of the training models fodlers we provide the grid search performed for all models presented in the paper plus a few other optional models, we provid this same script which will allow the user to do it without any text features, and our bootstrapping script with will pull the best performing features from a related dictionary and run 100 bootstraps.
We also provided the paper free of access in the Research Paper folders.
Lastly, in the Model Scripts there are three sub-folders feature extraction, Model evaluation, and preprocessing.
These folders contain all the rule learners, emotion, nlp, word2vec, and sentiment feature scripts that we added to the data.
THe model evaluation contains all of the scripts used to check for signifcance in the data and to plot images for comparison.
